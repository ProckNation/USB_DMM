USB_DMM
=======

An Arduino based digital multimeter(voltage and current) for USB connected devices. Will show current used by the connected device and the current voltage level on the USB cable.
Not all of these features are set in stone yet.  This is a new project just started on 12-4-2014 and I am ust getting some ideas down.
Features
======

It will have a 20x4 character LCD display with a backlight.

The display will show minimum, maximum, average, and live values for both voltage and current.

Will have buttons to allow navigating some kind of menu structure.

Will use an Arduino MCU to drive the USB DMM. Maybe a Pro Mini or Trinket Pro.
